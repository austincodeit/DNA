The Combined Planing Area includes three individual planning areas –
MLK, MLK-183, and Pecan Springs/Springdale. Residents, business owners,
and property owners have been meeting with City staff since February 2002 to
develop this plan to improve their neighborhood and to guide future development. Givens Park and Morris Wiliams Golf Course are the two largest park and recreational facilities in the district.
